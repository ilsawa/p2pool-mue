Dear MUE community, we have suffered a huge attack on the network.

It appears to have been a kind of replay/re-organisation attack POW coins have been victim of in recent months and that was able to obtain MUE in the millions. We have decided on immediate action/resolution. As per the community vote some weeks back in which 57% voted for a move to a POS (proof of stake) coin with MasterNodes & budgets, that is exactly what we are going to do. We will perform a coin swap 1:1 for all transactions up to and including block 833658

This is the last block that was accepted for deposits/withdrawals with Bittrex & also means the attacker will get NOTHING as the attacks happened after this block. The move to POS was something the team were looking at doing at some point, this has just aided our decision to make this happen sooner. We ask you, please DO NOT move your coins or mine. We sincerely apologise for this attack, we thank you for your support, and we will continue to do our absolute best for this project and its community.

Team MUE
